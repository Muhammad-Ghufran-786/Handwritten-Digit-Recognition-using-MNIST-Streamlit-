# 🧠 Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning (MNIST + Streamlit)

This project is a simple yet powerful web app that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using a neural network trained on the **MNIST dataset**.  
It’s built with **TensorFlow/Keras** for model training and **Streamlit** for the interactive user interface.
